  "summary": "PRs `browserstack/app-uploader/pull/2252` and `browserstack/railsApp/pull/136184` introduce logic to upload files to the nearest S3 bucket region by default for all `app-uploader` and `codesigner` uploads. This is expected to reduce upload times in APS and APSE regions and lower inter-region network costs.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Slack thread: https://browserstack.slack.com/archives/CPDTKNQ4A/p1751003409027829?thread_ts=1751003409.027829&cid=CPDTKNQ4A",

  "summary_subject": "App Automate GRR: Incorrect App Pricing Despite US IP Assignment",
  "summary": "A customer with US region GRR (Geo-Restricted Routing) enabled on App Automate is encountering unexpected pricing details within their app in some sessions. The customer believes this is due to devices not being assigned from the US region, which violates their app's restrictions. However, the terminal IP for a reported 'failed' session (209.10.139.190) was verified as US-assigned, and GRR is confirmed enabled on the account. The issue persists even when BrowserStack allocates a US IP, suggesting a potential problem within the customer's application. Further debugging steps are requested to diagnose the root cause.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Slack thread: https://browserstack.slack.com/archives/CPDTKNQ4A/p1750973208917109?thread_ts=1750973208.917109&cid=CPDTKNQ4A",
