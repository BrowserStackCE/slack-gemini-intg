  "summary": "A customer (GID: XXXXX) using WDIO for a POC is encountering a 'Screen Broadcast' pop-up during their App Automate sessions, occurring approximately 3 out of 10 times. Initial analysis suggests the customer's script might be triggering the pop-up by clicking a red icon, potentially due to the use of a generic identifier which explains the inconsistency. The team is requested to reproduce the issue using Appium Inspector and investigate the root cause of the intermittent behavior.",

  "summary": "Viber (GID - XXXXX) is experiencing an issue where their iOS app fails to reinstall mid-session on dedicated devices. This occurs because their app requires entitlement support, necessitating the use of `resignApp:false`, which is currently incompatible with the `otherApps` capability. The customer cannot modify their app's versioning and is unable to split test cases into separate sessions due to limited device availability, making the use of `otherApps` or `midSessionInstallApps` non-negotiable for critical test flows. The problem has persisted since March, despite multiple attempts to find a solution.",

  "summary": "The discussion revolves around the management of a new certificate, `production_122_02062025`. Initially, a request was made to block this certificate on the `codesigner` system. It was clarified that this is a direct certificate addition for a new email, meaning no old certificate was involved, and no rotation was required. The certificate was successfully blocked, and subsequently, a job was run to add it to `codesigner`, which was confirmed as completed. Instructions were provided to create a ticket on the `AAP board`/`AAP dashboard` for tracking.",
