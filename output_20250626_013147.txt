  "summary": "An unnamed client has raised several technical questions regarding the Accessibility testing feature. They require detailed clarification on how pages are counted for billing purposes, including definitions for 'new page' (e.g., URL variations, repeated access) and whether counting rules are consistent across Automate and Website Scanner features. The client also reported intermittent failures in generating reports for their accessibility test builds and is seeking a root cause. Finally, they inquired about the compatibility of their Playwright-based test architecture, which uses contexts for specific panels, with the Accessibility testing functionality.",
